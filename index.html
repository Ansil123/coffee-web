            <p class="container border border-5 border-black p-5 mt-5">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that
                drinking coffee is generally safe within usual
                levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4
                cups of coffee daily. <br>
                Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk
                in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. <br>
                Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and
                serving size.</p>

            <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a

                    tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the
                    Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures
                    between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is
                    resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees
                    Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong
